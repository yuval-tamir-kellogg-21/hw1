Project Description:

I created a very rough website for the startup I work for - Zaraz.

Zaraz is a third party manager that improves website loading speeds by as much as 65% by optimizing the way the website loads third party scripts.

In this website you can currently find:
1) a homepage with the main message and an illustration
2) a product page explaining some of the key benefits
3) a pricing page explaining the different plans

These pages are linked to each other.
I made sure to use these elements:
-Headers (h1, h2, etc)
-p
-ul/li or table
-a
-img
